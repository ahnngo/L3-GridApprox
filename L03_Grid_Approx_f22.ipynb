This should be no more than two paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did plan to complete the lab but I was not able to do so even with extensive studying. However, 70% of my plan evolved and the final result was the methods that I was asked to complete. I spent 10 hours in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PERSONNEL**: A description of who you worked with and on what sections.  It is expected that all collaboration is done as pair programming together. Also, note these collaborations in the code section itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked by myself in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHALLENGES**: Descriptions of the largest challenges you overcame and what made them challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest challenge is to understand the intuition behind the requirement. I was trying my best to research on it but there was limitted resources I could find. I was not able to make it to the office hours so this lab was very challenging to me. \n",

    "**INNOVATIONS**: Any innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment. These are not required, but should be highlighted if included.\n",

    "I was not making any innovations in this lab. \n",

    "**TESTING**: Describe how you tested this work.\n",

    "I printed things out line by line to see whether it worked like what I expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ERRORS**: A list in bulleted form of all known errors and deficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "My kernel keeps sending errors that it has died due to systematic errors. I also was not able to separate nodes on the partition line to different sections. However, all required methods should work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**COMMENTS**: A paragraph or so of your own comments on and reactions to the Lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think this lab is very hard and challenging by the fact that I am not very experienced with recursion myself. That should be something I need to improve in the future. However, it is a great learning experience. "
